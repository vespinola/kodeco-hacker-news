Chapter 15 Exercise from [Combine: Asynchronous Programming with Swift](https://www.kodeco.com/books/combine-asynchronous-programming-with-swift).

## Getting Started With “News”
The starter project for this chapter already includes some code so that you can focus on writing code connecting Combine and SwiftUI.

The project also includes some folders where you will find the following:

App contains the main app type.
Network includes the completed Hacker News API from last chapter.
Model is where you will find simple model types like Story, FilterKeyword and Settings. Additionally, this is where ReaderViewModel resides, which is the model type that the main newsreader view uses.
View contains the app views and, inside View/Helpers, you will find some simple reusable components like buttons, badges, etc.
Finally, in Util there is a helper type that allows you to easily read and write JSON files to/from disk.
